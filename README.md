# neo-scripts

These are just some tools I made to make my Neopets experience a little better. Maybe they’ll help you enjoy the site more, too!

## How to Install

To install a script:

-   Click on the script filename in this repository.
-   Click the "Raw" button at the top right of the file view.
-   Your userscript manager (such as Tampermonkey) should prompt you to install the script automatically.

This works for Tampermonkey, Greasemonkey, Violentmonkey, and most other userscript managers.

## Scripts

-   [ignore-user-posts.user.js](ignore-user-posts.user.js):
    -   **Ignore Users on Neoboards** – Hide posts from specific users on the Neopets Neoboards. Features a management panel to add or remove ignored users, and hides their posts.

## License

See the LICENSE file for details. You are free to use, modify, and distribute these scripts as you wish.
