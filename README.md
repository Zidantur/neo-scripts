# neo-scripts

These are just some tools I made to make my Neopets experience a little better. Maybe they’ll help you enjoy the site more, too!

## How to Install

To install a script:

-   Click on the script filename in this repository.
-   Click the "Raw" button at the top right of the file view.
-   Your userscript manager (such as Tampermonkey) should prompt you to install the script automatically.

This works for Tampermonkey, Greasemonkey, Violentmonkey, and most other userscript managers.

## Scripts

-   [KOTB.js](KOTB.user.js):
